#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Give a deep quote about life or success  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.  

These are the only files that must be edited or added to satisfy the request.

A stylized emblem featuring a minimalist tree with roots and branches forming a subtle upward arrow, symbolizing growth, resilience, and the pursuit of success. The background is a soft gradient from deep teal at the top to a calm sage green at the bottom, evoking calmness and focus. The tree is rendered in a clean, flat style with a single line thickness, and the arrow subtly points upward, suggesting progress and aspiration. The overall composition is balanced and centered, conveying a sense of harmony and forward momentum.
